  <h1>Particle World</h1>
  <p>For my project I wanted to create something kind gross and eerie. I drew inspiration from insects that scurry across the floor. My particles resembles beetles and they scurry across the floor at varying speeds. Once they reach the end of the canvas they switch directions and then scurry the other way.
